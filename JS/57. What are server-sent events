What are server-sent events
Server-sent events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a browser to receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection without resorting to polling. 
These are a one way communications channel - events flow from server to client only. 
This has been used in Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds etc.
