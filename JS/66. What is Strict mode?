Strict mode in JavaScript is a way to opt into a restricted variant of the language, introduced in ECMAScript 5 (ES5).
By enabling strict mode, you can catch common coding errors, prevent the use of certain unsafe features, 
and improve performance in some cases by allowing JavaScript engines to optimize code more efficiently.
