Events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, 
JavaScript can react on these events. Some of the examples of HTML events are,

Web page has finished loading
Input field was changed
Button was clicked
Let's describe the behavior of click event for button element,

<!doctype html>
<html>
 <head>
   <script>
     function greeting() {
       alert('Hello! Good morning');
     }
   </script>
 </head>
 <body>
   <button type="button" onclick="greeting()">Click me</button>
 </body>
</html>
