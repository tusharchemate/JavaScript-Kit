/* Map Vs Object */


/* Map is similar as a Object it keeps an insertion order */
/* Key are in Map are Order and while retriving it showing the order but in case this is not in case objects */
/* We can get this size of Object by using size but in case of object we need to find out manually. */
/* Map Perform better in scanario involving addition/deletion of key  */
