// Hoisting - 
// Hoisting in JavaScript is a mechanism where variable and function declarations 
// are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. 

// TDZ - Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) occurs when we try to access variables declared 
// with `let` or `const` before their initialization, which results in a ReferenceError.

console.log(a); // undefined (hoisted, but initialized to undefined)
var a; 

console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b; 

console.log(c); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'c' before initialization
const c; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
